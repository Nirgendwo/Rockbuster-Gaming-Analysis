# Rockbuster-Gaming-Analysis
I have been hired by Rockbuster Stealthâ€™s business intelligence (BI) department to help with the launch strategy for the new online video service. The BI department helps other departments, from inventory to customer insights, with data-related queries using SQL.

### Main Questions I answered:
- Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
- What was the average rental duration for all videos?
- Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
- Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
- Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

My [Data Dictonary](https://github.com/Nirgendwo/Rockbuster-Gaming-Analysis/blob/01c16434d2ebe94649c3e4b49e2a7e63b91b9d71/Data-Dictionary.pdf)  
After loading the data into a RDBMS, I started analysing the data using SQL querrys. The content of the analysis can be fount in the [analysis folder](https://github.com/Nirgendwo/Rockbuster-Gaming-Analysis/tree/main/Analysis).  
The last step was to create the [final report](https://github.com/Nirgendwo/Rockbuster-Gaming-Analysis/blob/70dca47c62786e5d720d6f4fcf39b3f266a06fd7/Final-Report.pdf).
