# Rockbuster-Gaming-Analysis
I have been hired by Rockbuster Stealthâ€™s business intelligence (BI) department to help with the launch strategy for the new online video service. The BI department helps other departments, from inventory to customer insights, with data-related queries using SQL.

### Main Questions I answered:
- Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
- What was the average rental duration for all videos?
- Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
- Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
- Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
